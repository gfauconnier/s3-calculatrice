#Semaine 3 : Calculator

##Presentation :  
We had to do a calculator using js/DOM.

##What's inside :  
__index.html__ : I used buttons for numbers and operators, and a _p_ for display. I used bootstrap  
classes for buttons styling.  
__main.css__ : Added a font and a few declarations, nothing fancy.  
__main.js__ : Quite a few functions depending on the type of button clicked (number, operator or 'unique'   buttons (Reset, C, +/-)). I did lots of checks to make sure no mistakes can be made.

##How ?  
JS + DOM
